first clone it 

then u wanna run the following commands on your cmd 
C:\Users\User\MachineLearning\Proejct>python -m venv venv  this creates a viurtual environment to give you the necessary libraries you would need for the project 


C:\Users\User\MachineLearning\Proejct>venv\Scripts\activate
this would activate that VD(virtual d3esktop)
 
(venv) C:\Users\User\MachineLearning\Proejct>pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas   notice how there is a "(venv)" means the virtaul network is successfully connected these are the command you need **pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas **

(venv) C:\Users\User\MachineLearning\Proejct\DeployMLModel-Flask>python model.py   then head over to the following "DeployMLModel" directory to  access the files you wanna ruin the "python model.py"


thanks
